-> if parent has a abstract method then any function interface
    extending that interface should not add any new abstract method
    because functional interface can have only one abstract method
-> normal interface extending functional interface can have
    multiple abstract methods
-> one functional interface extending other functional interface
    then parent should have only one abstract method
    and child should have the same method or no abstract
